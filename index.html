        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>Uncanny</strong>, a multiplayer horror survival game set in the mysterious town of <strong>Hawthorn Hills</strong>, North Carolina. Players must survive the relentless pursuit of monstrous entities known as "The Senses".
        </p>
        <p>
            As you explore the dark alleys and abandoned buildings of Hawthorn Hills, you'll uncover secrets that the town has kept hidden for decades. Your goal is not just to survive, but to piece together the story of why these monstrous entities are hunting you. In <strong>Uncanny</strong>, each decision you make could be the difference between life and death, and every encounter with The Senses brings new terror.
        </p>
        <p>
            With immersive gameplay that challenges your perception of reality, <strong>Uncanny</strong> pushes players to use strategy, stealth, and cunning to outmaneuver The Senses. Whether you're hiding from Vigilus's unblinking gaze or evading Auditus's acute hearing, you'll need to stay one step ahead to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game's dynamic environments and AI-driven creatures ensure that no two playthroughs are the same. Players can join forces with friends or go solo as they navigate the eerie landscape, all while managing limited resources and solving intricate puzzles that reveal more about the game’s haunting lore.

        <h2>The Senses</h2>
        <p>
            The Senses are not just your average monsters; they are manifestations of humanity's deepest fears. Each Sense has its own distinct abilities that challenge different aspects of gameplay, forcing players to adapt their strategies on the fly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Vigilus (Vision)</strong>: Vigilus is a tall, gaunt figure with eyes that glow eerily in the dark. Its skin is pale, almost translucent, and its movements are unnervingly precise. Its eyes are large and multifaceted, giving it an almost insect-like appearance. Vigilus can see from great distances and has a wide field of vision, allowing it to spot players even in dimly lit areas. It can detect movement and track players across large areas and can temporarily enhance its vision to see through obstacles or detect hidden players.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Auditus (Hearing)</strong>: Auditus is a creature with an exaggeratedly large, membranous ears that twitch and swivel with every sound. Its body is emaciated and sinewy, covered in dark, mottled skin. It has a constant, twitching motion as if it's always listening. Auditus can hear faint sounds and detect even the slightest noise, reacting to footsteps, voices, and other sounds made by players. It uses sound waves to detect hidden players or objects and can pinpoint their location based on their voice if they speak too loudly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Olfacio (Smell)</strong>: Olfacio has a bloated, almost grotesque appearance with an elongated, protruding nose and a massive, flaring nostril. Its skin is a sickly green, with a slimy texture. It leaves a trail of unpleasant odor wherever it goes. Olfacio can track players by detecting their scent, following trails and lingering odors. It can sense the presence of players based on the scents they leave behind and can detect players even if they try to hide or use camouflaging tactics.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Tactus (Touch)</strong>: Tactus is a blind, hulking monster with a heavily muscled frame and large, sensitive hands. Its skin is tough and textured, resembling coarse bark. Tactus can feel vibrations through the ground and detect any movement or disturbances, including footsteps and physical interactions. Despite being blind, Tactus uses its enhanced sense of touch to navigate and track players, detecting their presence based on seismic disturbances such as running or jumping.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Gustus (Taste)</strong>: Gustus has a repulsive, almost insect-like appearance with a maw full of sharp, jagged teeth. Its tongue is long and prehensile, and its body is covered in a slimy, mucous layer. Gustus can detect players by tracking the consumable items they carry, sensing the presence and direction of players with a significant amount of food or other edibles. It becomes more aggressive when it detects large quantities of consumables and will focus its efforts on locating players with the most edible items.
        </p>
        <p>
            These creatures are more than just obstacles; they are central to the game's narrative and player experience, each representing a different way to experience fear. Facing off against The Senses requires both nerves of steel and quick thinking.

        <h2>Uncanny Lore</h2>
        <p>
            The town of <strong>Hawthorn Hills</strong> has always been shrouded in mystery. Founded in the early 1900s, it was a thriving community until a series of strange disappearances and unsolved crimes plagued the town. As the years went by, the townsfolk started to speak of the strange creatures lurking in the shadows, giving rise to urban legends about "The Senses".
        </p>
        <p>
            Many believe that the town’s founder, Elias Hawthorn, was involved in occult practices that unleashed a curse upon the land. Ritual sites, hidden catacombs, and eerie landmarks dot the landscape, each holding a piece of the puzzle that is the town's dark history.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players will uncover diaries, audio recordings, and forgotten relics that piece together the tragic past of Hawthorn Hills. These discoveries not only provide clues to surviving The Senses but also delve into the personal stories of those who once called this place home.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lore of <strong>Uncanny</strong> is woven into every aspect of gameplay, encouraging players to explore every corner of the map, solve cryptic puzzles, and confront the dark forces that haunt the town.
